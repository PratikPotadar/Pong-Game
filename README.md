2 Player Pong Game
Welcome to the Pong game! Get ready for an exciting head-to-head 
competition where you and your opponent will test your skills in a classic arcade-style 
game. The objective is simple: use your paddles to hit the ball back and forth, aiming to 
outscore your opponent.

Player 1, you will control the paddle on the left side of the screen. Use the 
designated keys or controls to move your paddle up and down. Your goal is to prevent the 
ball from passing your paddle and score points by hitting it past Player 2's paddle.

Player 2, you will control the paddle on the right side of the screen. Utilize the 
provided controls to move your paddle up and down. Your objective is to block the ball 
from crossing your paddle and score points by hitting it beyond Player 1's paddle.
React quickly, position your paddle strategically, and time your moves precisely to 
keep the ball in play and outsmart your opponent. The game will become increasingly 
challenging as the ball's speed may increase over time. Communicate with your opponent, 
analyze their movements, and find opportunities to gain an advantage. Employ various 
tactics and tricks to deceive your opponent and score points effectively.

The match continues until a specific score is reached or a predetermined time limit 
elapses. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score emerges as the victor
